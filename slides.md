# Achievements

The Forward Pass 
![The 1895 team](https://tarheelmania.files.wordpress.com/2007/09/1892-football-team.jpg?w=780)

<aside class="notes">
UNC has greatly contributed to the game of football in one important respect - the forward pass.  
In 1895, UNC invented the forward pass in a game against the University of Georgia. 
It was a fourth down and UNC was looking to punt the ball away.  Instead, the punter ran to the side of the field and threw the ball in the air. It was caught by a Tar Heel, who then ran 70 yards for a touchdown.

# This Season's Offense

![Ryan](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&ved=0ahUKEwjMyLC9_v_NAhXEdD4KHfzLDOkQjRwIBw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.campusrush.com%2Fryan-switzer-north-carolina-tar-heels-football-1724499851.html&psig=AFQjCNH1BlGUUJfoNnBY6_7wki9bPl3oKQ&ust=1469033513998048)
![Elijah](http://chapelboro.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/elijah-hood-sc.jpg)

<aside class="notes">
Last season, Mitch Trubisky was the backup to Marquise Williams.  He completed 85.1% of his passes for 555 yards and 6 touchdowns with no interceptions. This season, he is going to be a key player on offense and a lot of people are looking for him to really excel.
Ryan Switzer, a rising senior, is a huge part of the offense.  He is small but very fast and evasive.  He'll definitely be a key target for Trubisky.
Elijah Hood had a great sophomore year and should be great this year. Last season he ran for almost 1,500 yards and 17 touchdowns.

<aside class="notes">
Cayson Collins and Des Lawrence are going to be two key players for the defense this year.  UNC is looking to build on the progress they made last year after several seasons of disappointing defense.
